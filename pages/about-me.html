        <h1 class="text-success">This is me!</h1>
        <h3 class="text-white-50">My name is Gabriel</h3>
        <p class="text-info">I'm an amateur programmer born in Thailand. My passion for coding comes from my father who
            supports me in my path and also is a programmer, a software engineer to be precise. <br>
            Over time I began to study the art of code and decided to further my career in said ambition. I have learned
            a lot in the time I do this as both as a side-project at home and with my dad who loves to teach me this
            craft. <br>
            It is very inspiring to see my dad so passionate about this and thus I plan to carry on his torch and become
            an expert like he is! I love the puzzle solving element to coding and thoroughly enjoy to type away and
            watch my code come to life when I test it out, watch it evolve from nothing to a feasible thing seen on
            screen. <br>
            Furthermore it interests me greatly to see tech develop and my dream is to one day help it reach new
            heights. To hear the innovations and to be at the forefront of it would be incredibly fantastic!
